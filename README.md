## üìÑ Abstract

Credit card fraud remains a critical threat to financial institutions and e-commerce platforms, demanding real-time and reliable detection solutions. This project presents a fraud detection system developed using **Java EE technologies**, including **Java 8, JSP, Servlets**, and **MySQL**.

The system uses **rule-based validation** to instantly identify fraudulent transactions through checks on:
- CVV
- Expiry dates
- Transaction limits
- Suspicious activity patterns

An interactive **admin dashboard** allows manual review of flagged transactions, enhancing **security and transparency**. Unlike complex ML-based systems, this rule-based solution is highly efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world, high-volume transactions.

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits
- Significant reduction in fraud incidents
- Minimized false positives
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Improved system transparency
